# First lesson is to calculate mean, median and mode
# Create a vector with the sample numbers

x <- c(64630, 11735, 14216, 99233, 14470, 4978, 73429, 38120, 51135, 67060)

# Calculate the mean & assign to a variable

mean_x <- mean(x)

# Calculate the median & assign to a variable

median_x <- median(x)

# There is no built in function for mode in R, so one has to be created.

getmode <- function(x) {
  uniqx <- unique(x)
  uniqx[which.max(tabulate(match(x, uniqx)))]
}

# Calculate the mode & assign to a variable. Include sort so the smallest number is picked.

mode_x <- getmode(sort(x))

# Output. Cat instead of print so the outcome is only numbers without [1].

cat(mean_x, sep = "\n")
cat(median_x, sep = "\n")
cat(mode_x)
